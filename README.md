  # 📐 Graphite
  ### AI-Powered Engineering Drawing to 3D Visualizer
</div>

Graphite is an advanced educational tool that transforms 2D engineering drawings and sketches into interactive 3D models. Powered by **Google Gemini**, it helps students and engineers visualize complex component assemblies, understand construction steps, and generate technical documentation.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📸 **Smart Scan & Generation**
- **Camera Capture**: Integrated camera support with a custom viewfinder for capturing physical drawings.
- **AI Validation**: Automatically verifies if an image is a valid engineering drawing before processing.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 3 Preview to interpret orthogonal/isometric views and generate Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) models.

### 🏗️ **Interactive Studio**
- **Dual View Modes**: Switch seamlessly between **Assembled** and **Exploded (Split)** views to understand part relationships.
- **Wireframe & Dimensions**: Toggle technical overlays for precise inspection.
- **Unit Support**: Check dimensions in Millimeters (mm) or Centimeters (cm).

### 🤖 **AI Engineering Tutor**
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Ask questions about the specific model being viewed. The AI understands the part list, dimensions, and geometry.
- **Markdown Support**: Chat responses are formatted with clear bullet points, bold key terms, and structured paragraphs.
- **Audio Construction Guide**: Listen to step-by-step assembly instructions generated by natural-sounding AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Audio).

### 📄 **Professional Exports**
- **Smart PDF Reports**: Export "Assembled", "Split", or "Combined" technical reports.
- **Auto-Framing**: Intelligent camera logic ensures the model is perfectly scaled and centered in the PDF, regardless of your screen zoom.
- **Detailed Instructions**: Automatically appends a parts list and step-by-step construction guide to the export.
